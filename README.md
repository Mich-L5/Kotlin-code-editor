# Kotlin Code Editor Guide

## Prerequisites and Libraries
To get started, simply download the project files and open them in IntelliJ IDEA. Ensure Java and JavaFX are installed.

## Running the Project
After loading the files in IntelliJ IDEA, press the play button to launch the program. This will open a new instance of the Kotlin code editor.

### Creating a New File
To create a new file, click the "New +" button. A pop-up window will prompt you to enter a file name, which must be between 1–30 characters. Ensure each file name is unique. Once you’ve named the file, click "Create File" to create it. The new Kotlin file will appear in the left sidebar.

### Editing Files
To edit a file, select it from the left sidebar. The file’s content will load in the main IDE editor, where changes can be made directly.

### Saving Files
Files are automatically saved when switching between them. To manually save a file before exiting, click the Save button.

### Deleting Files
To delete a file, select it from the left sidebar and click the "Delete File" button. Confirm the action in the pop-up window by selecting "Confirm Delete."

### Changing the Theme
To change the IDE’s theme, use the dropdown menu in the upper-right corner of the screen. Select your preferred theme from the available options.
